<h4><strong>Brief</strong></h4>
    In the game 2 players move in four directions:
    <ul>
        <li>UP</li>
        <li>DOWN</li>
        <li>RIGHT</li>
        <li>LEFT</li>
    </ul>
    In each turn player has to make one move. Each player leaves a trace of his movement.
    When the player hits the border of the board or the trace of one of the players 
    (including his own trace) he loses. The aim of the game is to outlive the opponent.

<h4><strong>Input</strong></h4>
The input consist of several parts:
<ul>
    <li>In the first line there are 2 integers N, nr denoting the size of 
        the board and player number</li>
    <li>In each the next 2 lines there are 2 integers r, c, denoting the position of
        the player number k (k = 0, 1). r - row number, c - column number.
    </li>
    <li> In the next N lines there are N integers. That describes the board state. Their values mean:
        <ul> 
            <li>-1 - the field is empty</li>
            <li>i - the field is occupied by the trace of i-th player</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Output</strong></h4>
You should print one string ("UP", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "LEFT") - your move.
